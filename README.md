Congratulaions! You've inherited a large plot of land in Texas from a distant relative you didn't know you had...

Time to go Drilling for Oil!🛢️⛽

This program will help you find and drill all the oil reservoirs on your land. The program accepts as input a .txt file containing on the first line two integers M and N separated by a space. An M x N grid of space separated values representing a map of the land immediately follows on the following lines of the .txt file. The land map contains two possible values at each of the MN possible grid locations: a 'P' representing petroleum, or a 'd' representing plain ole oil-free dirt. An oil reservoir is defined as any vertical or horizontal connection of oil, or 'P', grid locations. The land you miraculously inherited is a encoded in a 4 x 5 land map called Inheritance.txt.
